CS220 - Computer Systems II - Architecture and Programming
Code by Christopher Zhang

An interactive dictionary storage program that allows the addition, removal,
and modification of words.

Parses an input file consisting of one word per file line and stores them in a
sorted format. 

Allows the user the following functionality based on arguments that are passed:

Search - Test to see if an input word exists in the dictionary
Insert - Add a word to the dictionary
Remove - Delete a word from the dictionary
Count  - Get how many words the dictionary contains
Quit   - Write the current dictionary to a file specified in command-line args

Notes:
The sample input files are current in the directory dIn/ to avoid clutter with
code files. Here is an example of compiling and running the code (commands).

>>make
>>./lab2 dIn/10-words.txt out.txt

Memory leaks were checked with valgrind

This is an example:
>>valgrind --log-file=valLog --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes ./lab2
    d/10-words.txt dictionary.txt

Another executable offers a faster way to complete the assignment using a 
modified hashing algorithm known as djb2. To run it, simply use the
executable 'lab2-bonus' rather than 'lab2'.
